spring-websocket-test
=====================

Test bed for spring websockets
the main branch is useless
stomp-onlly is a working demo
adapted from http://sunitkatkar.blogspot.com/2014/01/spring-4-websockets-with-sockjs-stomp.html using a running
activemq instance and talking to that instance via stomp.
I couldn't get the spring stuff in main working
